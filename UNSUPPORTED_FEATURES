* does not work with :dependent => nullify because
  def nullify_has_many_dependencies(record, reflection_name, association_class, primary_key_name, dependent_conditions)
    association_class.update_all("#{primary_key_name} = NULL", dependent_conditions)
  end

  This does not trigger callbacks
* update_all, delete, update_counter, increment_counter, decrement_counter, counter_caches in general
* attr_readonly - no technical obstacle, just not yet supported
* attributes before typecast behave unpredictably - hard to support
* ActiveRecord::Rollback is unsupported - the exception gets swallowed so there isn't an opportunity to rollback the cache transaction - not hard to support
